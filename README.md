# "OneShot" Demo for TI-84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator
This is "OneShot", traditionally a game played on PC (and soon-to-be consoles too), ported to the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator.

I made this because I saw a [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneshot/comments/quy9ps/imagine_oneshot_on_a_graphing_calculator/) posing "OneShot on calculator" as a hypothetical, so I decided to make it a bit of a reality.

I think it would be cool if I could accurately port the game up until the end of the tutorial area, but for now it's definitely still in "demo for reddit" stage.

Want to contribute? Go ahead, but keep in mind that if you've ever done any project in C, sorry in advance. This project is my first time using C for anything, so no doubt you'll be running laps around me.

You'll also need the [CE C Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain), which is the framework that made this whole project possible without learning Assembly.
